We're excited to introduce **Chatterbox Multilingual**, [Resemble AI's](https://resemble.ai) first production-grade open source TTS model supporting **23 languages** out of the box. Licensed under MIT, Chatterbox has been benchmarked against leading closed-source systems like ElevenLabs, and is consistently preferred in side-by-side evaluations.

Whether you're working on memes, videos, games, or AI agents, Chatterbox brings your content to life across languages. It's also the first open source TTS model to support **emotion exaggeration control** with robust **multilingual zero-shot voice cloning**. Try the english only version now on our [English Hugging Face Gradio app.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ResembleAI/Chatterbox). Or try the multilingual version on our [Multilingual Hugging Face Gradio app.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ResembleAI/Chatterbox-Multilingual-TTS).

If you like the model but need to scale or tune it for higher accuracy, check out our competitively priced TTS service (<a href="https://resemble.ai">link</a>). It delivers reliable performance with ultra-low latency of sub 200ms‚Äîideal for production use in agents, applications, or interactive media.

# Key Details

# Supported Languages 
Arabic (ar) ‚Ä¢ Danish (da) ‚Ä¢ German (de) ‚Ä¢ Greek (el) ‚Ä¢ English (en) ‚Ä¢ Spanish (es) ‚Ä¢ Finnish (fi) ‚Ä¢ French (fr) ‚Ä¢ Hebrew (he) ‚Ä¢ Hindi (hi) ‚Ä¢ Italian (it) ‚Ä¢ Japanese (ja) ‚Ä¢ Korean (ko) ‚Ä¢ Malay (ms) ‚Ä¢ Dutch (nl) ‚Ä¢ Norwegian (no) ‚Ä¢ Polish (pl) ‚Ä¢ Portuguese (pt) ‚Ä¢ Russian (ru) ‚Ä¢ Swedish (sv) ‚Ä¢ Swahili (sw) ‚Ä¢ Turkish (tr) ‚Ä¢ Chinese (zh)
# Tips
- **General Use (TTS and Voice Agents):**
  - Ensure that the reference clip matches the specified language tag. Otherwise, language transfer outputs may inherit the accent of the reference clip‚Äôs language. To mitigate this, set `cfg_weight` to `0`.
  - The default settings (`exaggeration=0.5`, `cfg_weight=0.5`) work well for most prompts across all languages.
  - If the reference speaker has a fast speaking style, lowering `cfg_weight` to around `0.3` can improve pacing.

- **Expressive or Dramatic Speech:**
  - Try lower `cfg_weight` values (e.g. `~0.3`) and increase `exaggeration` to around `0.7` or higher.
  - Higher `exaggeration` tends to speed up speech; reducing `cfg_weight` helps compensate with slower, more deliberate pacing.


# Installation
```shell
pip install chatterbox-tts
```

Alternatively, you can install from source:
```shell
# conda create -yn chatterbox python=3.11
# conda activate chatterbox

git clone https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox.git
cd chatterbox
pip install -e .
```
We developed and tested Chatterbox on Python 3.11 on Debian 11 OS; the versions of the dependencies are pinned in `pyproject.toml` to ensure consistency. You can modify the code or dependencies in this installation mode.

# Usage
```python
import torchaudio as ta
from chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS
from chatterbox.mtl_tts import ChatterboxMultilingualTTS

# English example
model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device="cuda")

text = "Ezreal and Jinx teamed up with Ahri, Yasuo, and Teemo to take down the enemy's Nexus in an epic late-game pentakill."
wav = model.generate(text)
ta.save("test-english.wav", wav, model.sr)

# Multilingual examples
multilingual_model = ChatterboxMultilingualTTS.from_pretrained(device=device)

french_text = "Bonjour, comment √ßa va? Ceci est le mod√®le de synth√®se vocale multilingue Chatterbox, il prend en charge 23 langues."
wav_french = multilingual_model.generate(spanish_text, language_id="fr")
ta.save("test-french.wav", wav_french, model.sr)

chinese_text = "‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºå‰ªäÂ§©Â§©Ê∞îÁúü‰∏çÈîôÔºåÂ∏åÊúõ‰Ω†Êúâ‰∏Ä‰∏™ÊÑâÂø´ÁöÑÂë®Êú´„ÄÇ"
wav_chinese = multilingual_model.generate(chinese_text, language_id="zh")
ta.save("test-chinese.wav", wav_chinese, model.sr)

# If you want to synthesize with a different voice, specify the audio prompt
AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH = "YOUR_FILE.wav"
wav = model.generate(text, audio_prompt_path=AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH)
ta.save("test-2.wav", wav, model.sr)
```
See `example_tts.py` and `example_vc.py` for more examples.

## Streaming API

Chatterbox now ships with a lightweight FastAPI server that lets a locally
hosted LLM stream partial generations directly into the TTS engine and receive
chunked audio in response. The server lives at
`chatterbox.streaming_api:app`.

### Run the server

```bash
uvicorn chatterbox.streaming_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Run with Docker Compose

To launch the streaming server inside a container, build the provided image
and start the service with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker_compose.yml up --build
```

The compose file publishes port `8000` and persists model downloads in named
volumes so subsequent runs reuse cached checkpoints. Add `-d` to the command
to run the service in the background. For GPU acceleration, install the
[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)
and follow Docker's [GPU configuration guidance](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gpu-support/)
to expose your hardware to the container.

### Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/sessions`
  - Body: `{ "multilingual": false, "buffer_until_punctuation": true, ... }`
  - Creates a session and returns the `session_id`, sample rate, and buffering
    mode.
- `POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/stream`
  - Body: `{ "tokens": ["Hello", " world"], "is_final": false }`
  - Streams the provided tokens into the session. When buffering is enabled the
    server waits for punctuation before speaking; otherwise each request is
    synthesized immediately. The response is an `audio/wav` streaming response
    that emits PCM chunks as they are produced.
- `POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/buffer`
  - Body: `{ "enabled": true }`
  - Toggles the punctuation buffering switch on the fly.
- `DELETE /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}`
  - Closes the session and frees its resources.

Set `buffer_until_punctuation` to `false` during session creation (or toggle it
off later) to synthesize every token chunk immediately without waiting for
sentence boundaries. Send `"is_final": true` with the last chunk to flush any
remaining buffered text.

# Built-in PerTh Watermarking for Responsible AI

Every audio file generated by Chatterbox includes [Resemble AI's Perth (Perceptual Threshold) Watermarker](https://github.com/resemble-ai/perth) - imperceptible neural watermarks that survive MP3 compression, audio editing, and common manipulations while maintaining nearly 100% detection accuracy.


## Watermark extraction

You can look for the watermark using the following script.

```python
import perth
import librosa

AUDIO_PATH = "YOUR_FILE.wav"

# Load the watermarked audio
watermarked_audio, sr = librosa.load(AUDIO_PATH, sr=None)

# Initialize watermarker (same as used for embedding)
watermarker = perth.PerthImplicitWatermarker()

# Extract watermark
watermark = watermarker.get_watermark(watermarked_audio, sample_rate=sr)
print(f"Extracted watermark: {watermark}")
# Output: 0.0 (no watermark) or 1.0 (watermarked)
```
